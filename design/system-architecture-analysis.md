## 2. System Design Patterns

### 2.1 Frontend Architecture Patterns

**Patterns Used:**
- **Component-Based Architecture:** React components with proper separation
- **Compound Components:** shadcn/ui components
- **Provider Pattern:** React Context for state management
- **Form Handling Pattern:** react-hook-form with schema validation
- **Route-based Code Splitting:** Next.js app router

**Strengths:**
- Clear component hierarchy
- Reusable UI components
- Type-safe props and state
- Proper error boundaries (assumed)

**Weaknesses:**
- Context API may not scale well for complex state
- Limited performance optimizations (no evident memoization)

### 2.2 Backend Architecture Patterns

**Patterns Used:**
- **Model-View-Serializer (MVS):** Django REST Framework pattern
- **Repository Pattern:** Django ORM as repository layer
- **Serialization Pattern:** DRF serializers for data transformation
- **Authentication/Authorization Pattern:** JWT-based auth
- **Custom Exception Handling:** utils.custom_exception_handler

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper data validation and serialization
- RESTful API design
- Custom exception handling
- Database optimization with indexes

**Database Design:**
- **Normalization:** Proper 3NF normalization
- **Relationships:** Appropriate foreign key relationships
- **Constraints:** Business logic enforced at DB level
- **Indexes:** Performance optimization with strategic indexing

## 3. API Design Analysis

### 3.1 API Architecture

The application implements a RESTful API following REST principles:

```
Authentication Endpoints:
POST /api/signup/     - User registration
POST /api/signin/     - User authentication
GET  /api/profile/    - User profile

Campaign Management:
GET    /api/campaigns/        - List campaigns
POST   /api/campaigns/        - Create campaign
GET    /api/campaigns/{id}/   - Get campaign details
PUT    /api/campaigns/{id}/   - Update campaign
PATCH  /api/campaigns/{id}/   - Partial update
DELETE /api/campaigns/{id}/   - Delete campaign
```

**Strengths:**
- Follows REST conventions
- Proper HTTP methods usage
- Consistent URL patterns
- Comprehensive CRUD operations

**Weaknesses:**
- No API versioning strategy
- Missing rate limiting (configured but basic)
- No pagination for list endpoints
- Limited filtering capabilities

### 3.2 Data Models

The data model design is well-structured:

```python
# Core Models
Account (User) -> Campaign -> CampaignPayout
```

**Campaign Model:**
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Validation at model level
- Appropriate indexes for performance
- Business logic embedded in model

**CampaignPayout Model:**
- Complex business rules (worldwide vs country-specific)
- Database constraints for data integrity
- Property decorators for computed fields

## 4. Security Analysis

### 4.1 Current Security Measures

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT-based authentication
- Proper permission classes
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (basic)

**Data Protection:**
- Input validation with serializers
- SQL injection protection (ORM)
- CSRF protection enabled
- Password validation

### 4.2 Security Vulnerabilities

🚨 **Critical Issues:**

1. **JWT Storage in localStorage**
   - Vulnerable to XSS attacks
   - Should use httpOnly cookies

2. **Missing Security Headers**
   - No evidence of security headers configuration
   - Missing HSTS, CSP, etc.

3. **No Refresh Token Strategy**
   - Single JWT token without refresh mechanism
   - Poor security practice

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Potential exposure of sensitive data
   - Need proper secrets management
